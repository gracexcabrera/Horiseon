## Description

My motivation for this website was to create a website to help others with their marketing skills. I built this project in hopes to create an all-in-one quick but effective website, where one can turn to learn and improve their marketing skills. This website would solve the issue of having to look up multiple different websites inorder to learn more about marketing and how to do it effectively. I learned alot about divs, alts, and headers when editing this website. I would touch and attempt to fix them but would in turn cause the whole website to lose functionality so going back and forth to see what each input does help me to learn the root of the issue.
